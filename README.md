# CS50-Codes
My solutions to problem sets from Harvard's CS50.

- In problem sets 1-3 we were given options for programs based on whether we were "more" or "less" comfortable with programming. As such, file names will reflect which version of the assignment is represented by including (more) or (less) after the title.
